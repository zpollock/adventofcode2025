# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 🧊

## ❄️ It's a TypeScript Christmas!

This is my personal repo for tackling the daily challenges of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

### 🌟 What's This All About?

Nobody likes programming for money, but for free? Let's do this! 💸🚀

### ✨ Why TypeScript?

Because we deserve solutions that compile without mysterious runtime errors!  We're trading dynamic chaos for static clarity.
